# StreetEasy Monitor
When looking for an apartment in New York City, it's important to be on top of new rental listings because competition is intense and good deals often come and go very quickly. It's a good idea to periodically check the sites where listings get posted, especially StreetEasy, which is where the majority of legitimate listings end up. This can be very time consuming, so this project aims to automate the process.

This project includes a script (`main.py`) that checks the search results for a URL matching selected filters (defined in `src/streeteasymonitor/scraper.py`), checks if any new listings have been posted, and automatically messages the listing agent using personalized form input defined in `.env`. After messaging the agent, the listing is stored in a database. The script checks for new posts by comparing the listings found in the search results against the listings stored in the database, and performs additional optional filtering if desired. [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-py) is used for database operations.

A simple Flask application is included in the `app/` directory, which is served at `localhost:8000` by default. The purpose of the application is to monitor the search results based on a defined schedule using [Flask-APScheduler](https://viniciuschiele.github.io/flask-apscheduler/) to periodically execute `main.py`. The application defines a single route (`/`) which displays the listings that have been contacted, sorted by most recent. For each listing, the page shows when the agent was contacted, the address, the neighborhood, and the monthly rental price. If the rental has been indexed on Paddaddy, the link to the corresponding page on Paddaddy is provided; otherwise, the link to the original StreetEasy listing is given.
