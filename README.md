# StreetEasy Monitor
Python script that checks StreetEasy for new rentals matching search criteria and automatically messages new matches.

Includes a Flask application that provides a search interface and displays contacted listings, plus optional helper scripts for setting up a cron job.

### Features
- Uses a [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) Session with [fake-useragent](https://pypi.org/project/fake-useragent/) to bypass request blocking
- [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for HTML parsing
- [Supabase Python Client](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-py) for database operations
- [environs](https://pypi.org/project/environs/) for environment variable parsing
- Simple web app implemented with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/1.2.x/), and [Choices.js](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices)
- Integration with [Paddaddy](https://paddaddy.app/) for added rental info
- Helper scripts for cron job management
- [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code formatting

## Usage

### One-off script execution
```bash
(.venv) $ python main.py
```

### Run Flask application 
The application will run on port 8002 by default (can be changed in `app/app.py`).
```bash
(.venv) $ python -m app.app
```
The application consists of:
- A form that can be used to check for listings based on specified criteria
- A table listing every rental that has been contacted so far, sorted by most recent

When possible, listings link to their corresponding page on [Paddaddy](https://paddaddy.app/), and otherwise link to the original page on StreetEasy.

### (Optional) Create cron job
Setting up a cron job is the most straightforward way to run the script continuously, but it can be difficult to configure correctly. A collection of bash scripts are included to help streamline the process.

Navigate to the cron folder and make all scripts executable
```bash
(.venv) $ cd cron
(.venv) $ chmod +x `ls *.sh`
```

Create cron job

<i>Note: if using a virtual environment, it must be activated for the script to select the correct Python path.</i>
```bash
(.venv) $ ./create_cron.sh
```

Start the cron job
```bash
(.venv) $ ./start_cron.sh
```

Stop the cron job
```bash
(.venv) $ ./stop_cron.sh
```

## Installation
### Clone project
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/joeschermer/streeteasy-monitor.git
$ cd streeteasy-monitor
````
### (Recommended) Install Python and set up virtual environment using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/)  
Install Python 3.12.3  
```bash
$ pyenv install 3.12.3
```
Create virtual environment
```bash
$ pyenv virtualenv 3.12.3 .venv
```
Activate virtual environment
```bash
$ pyenv local .venv
```

### Install requirements
```bash
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
### Set up Supabase
Create a Supabase account and start a new project

Navigate to the SQL Editor and initialize the `listings` table by running the following command:
```sql
create table
  public.listings (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    listing_id text null,
    url text null,
    price numeric null,
    address text null,
    neighborhood text null,
    constraint listings_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint listings_listing_id_key unique (listing_id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

### Create .env file
```bash
$ touch .env
```
Add Supabase credentials 
```
SUPABASE_URL=[YOUR SUPABASE URL]
SUPABASE_KEY=[YOUR SUPABASE KEY]
```

Add your desired message, along with your phone number, email, and name. All fields are required.
```
MESSAGE=[YOUR MESSAGE]
PHONE=[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]
EMAIL=[YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS]
NAME=[YOUR NAME]
```
When the script runs, any matching listings will be sent the above information, and an automated email from StreetEasy will be sent to the address you provided indicating that the message has been sent.

### Configure default search parameters and optional filters
If you choose to run the script by itself or in a cron job, edit the `default` and `filters` dictionaries in `config.py` according to your preferences.

- `default`: defines the parameters that will be used when running the script directly (i.e., not through the Flask form)
- `filters`: defines substrings for filtering results not otherwise captured by StreetEasy (e.g. addresses on specific streets, URLs for "featured" listings which include the substring `'?featured=1'`)

Example:

```python
default = {
    'min_price': 1000,
    'max_price': 4500,
    'min_beds': 1,
    'max_beds': 2,
    'areas': [
        'Bedford-Stuyvesant',
        'Carroll Gardens',
        'Upper East Side',
    ],
}

filters = {
    'url': ['?featured=1', '?infeed=1'],
    'address': [
        'Fulton',
        'Atlantic',
        'Herkimer',
    ],
    'neighborhood': [
        'New Development',
        'Ocean Hill',
    ],
}
```
In this example, the script will check for rentals priced between $1,000 and $4,500, with 1-2 bedrooms, in the neighborhoods of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Carroll Gardens, and the Upper East Side. "Featured" listings will be excluded, and so will any rentals with addresses on Fulton, Atlantic, or Herkimer, or in the Ocean Hill sub-neighborhood.

### Configure cron helper scripts for script scheduling
The `cron/` directory contains the following files, which can be configured according to your preferences.
- `create_cron.sh`: Saves a cron command to `cron.dat`. The default cron job will run `main.py` every 8 minutes, but can be changed by reassigning `CRON_SCHEDULE`.
- `start_cron.sh`: Starts the cron job from `cron.dat`. The job will log stdout/stderr to `cron.log` by default.
- `stop_cron.sh`: Stops any active cron job and saves to `cron.dat`.
